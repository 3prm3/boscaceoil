Okay so here’s what I did to make it work in Catalina 

**Prerequisites**


In order to run it you will need Adobe Air installed on your Mac you can get it from : [Click Here](https://get.adobe.com/air/)

**Installation**

So as soon as you download the dmg file install it and enter your password if it asks

After the installation is done and it says successful and you exit it you’ll get a prompter’s like this :

Ignore it and click ok 

Now download and double click on the [Quarantine.command](https://github.com/Pikachuxxxx/boscaceoil/raw/master/Quarantine.command) file it will ask you to enter your password again and it may look something like this :

However you won’t be able to see the password, not a problem just type it and hit enter.

After it’s done download it should look like this :

Great you’re just one step away from getting BoscaCeoil up and running 

Download the [BoscaCeoilV3.app](https://github.com/Pikachuxxxx/boscaceoil/raw/master/BoscaCeoilV3.app.zip) and double click it and it should open up like any other app.
